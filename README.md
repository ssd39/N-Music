## What’s N-Music ❓

N-Music is an NFT platform  with visualizes NFT.

**N-Music = Near+NFT+Music**

An Ecosystem for artists to not only monetize their work but to also visualize them in a soothing way. 

## Inspiration 🦾

The data we mostly consume Today is in the form of visuals. Our love for visuals is obvious in the digital world and Music in its own formless pattern is uniquely rewarding. Design and music are intricately related to each other. And sight and sound are known to be intertwined.

The brain will find patterns or images where none really exist. Relaxation exercises lowered the chances of finding a pattern that wasn't really there.When we feel like we don't have command of our own fate, our brains often invent patterns that offer a sense of self-control And hence we by using Kinetic audio visual music or pattern music can help reflect emotional and cognitive state of a person by combining algorithms and creating as many patterns as we want. 

This motivated us to create an algorithm that could appropriately intertwine with the music and help listeners feel relaxed and focused.

## Brainstorm 🧠

We wanted to create a platform that leverages the power of Blockchain and NFT’s to empower artists as well as leverage that art to offer a unique solution to the users. We decided to take a targeted approach and targeted utility based arts that can offer users value for money. Music has been around for a long time and new utilities for music are getting discovered. We decided to merge music with visuals generated by an algorithm and the results are very soothing. We also wanted to target rising markets such as **“psychedelic art”** , **“ASMR”** and **“Audio Induced Sleep”**. 

Binaural Beats are very helpful in inducing sleep and are being used by many people but they lack the visual stimuli and minting various Binaural Beats and other kinds of Music form as NFT’s gives artists an incentive to keep creating quality content and the nft owner can earn from traffic to the Music.


- Empowering Indie Artists of all genres
- Blending Music and Visual Stimuli
- Better ways to monetize your work
- Various algorithm for different Effect

## Use Cases 🍍

Music itself has many use cases and when we assemble it with visual stimuli there are many things that can be achieved. In this section i had like to point out a few use cases.

**Sleeping Aid:**
 
Binaural Beats along with Visuals provides a soothing effect and can help induce sleep. Currently about  [$430 billion is spent each year on sleep aids](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1119471/size-of-the-sleep-economy-worldwide/) by people trying to achieve optimal sleep. The global sleep economy is expected to grow to $585 billion by 2024, according to market and consumer data company [Statista](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/statista).

**Celebration:** 

The demand for personalized gifts has been increasing constantly for years. Let’s drop the old ways of saying “Congratulations” , “Happy Birthday” and “Merry Christmas”. Let’s replace it with something that’s more tangible and something that’s everlasting. Mint your special audio messages as NFT and they will live forever. 
The global personalized gifts market was valued USD 26.3 Billion in 2019 and is anticipated to reach USD 41.3 Billion by 2026, expanding at a CAGR of 9.5% during the forecast period 2020-2026.

**Empowering Indie Artist:**

There are a lot of artists struggling to create their albums due to small budget and team size we want to allow people to invest in their favorite artists and grow along with them this creates a lot of opportunities for the Indie artist and helps investors to invest in a different asset class 

**…Many Others** 

## Infrastructure 🏗

![Infrastructure](https://n-music.b-cdn.net/WhatsApp%20Image%202022-02-21%20at%202.38.58%201.jpeg)

We are build to be resilient. Our infrastructure is designed very carefully keeping in mind the amount of effort and time users from all around the world will spend on our platform. We are totally decentralized.
Near Smart Contract : We have deployed 3 Smart Contracts on the Near network that helps us achieve our backend-logic in a truly decentralized way. 

**NFT-Pool-Factory :** Allows users to Deploy their NFT Smart-Contract and also whitelist the contracts that are deployed through it. 
Deployed here : https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/factory.nftmarketplace.testnet


**NFT-Contract :** This is a NFT-Contract Deployed by users. This contract is based on NEP-171 standard. Each nft creator deploys their own contract
Ex Nft contract : https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/poly.factory.nftmarketplace.testnet

**Market-Contract :** This contract  maintains all the listing of the NFT’s and has several view functions to view those listings 
Deployed here  : https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/market.nftmarketplace.testnet

**Graph Node :** We use hosted graph nodes to index the data for faster access. All the events from the smart contracts are recorded to the graph node providing the API’s for Front-end Developer.

## What it does 🔧

A Decentralized Music NFT platform utilizing various algorithms to build interactive artwork. 
Generates Intensive Psychedelic Visuals for Music.

- Mint your audio+visuals as NFT 
- Buy/Sell and Send NFT’s
- Invest in Artists and their future

## Challenges we ran into 💪

Rust was a new language for our team to develop smart contracts on. We have learnt a lot of things about rust and have spent hours debugging our code on it. 

Example for implementing graph on the Near network are very few and we sometimes the graph is a bit slow in syncing the near network

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 😎

- Writing smart contract in rust
- Developing a working prototype 

## What's next for N-Music ⏭️

We want to work on growing the project organically. Building various different algorithms with dynamic screens. We also want to work on onboarding artists to our platform.Also we want to implement an NEP-141 fungible token for every artist which than can be distributed to there loyal fan and investor so they can grow alongside with the artists
